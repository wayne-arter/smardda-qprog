The script qprog.bash will set up a conforming program and try to run it, it does not
need SMARDDA-LIB installation if the optional -l (for locally complete) appears as first argument.
The program name, its abbreviation (typically one or two letters) and description are defined using
the keys QPROG, Q and STR. The name of a skeleton module to be tested, its abbreviation
and description are defined using the keys BIGOBJ, BO and BSTR, as indicated:
./qprog.bash -l \
QPROG=xpc Q=xp STR="transport_coefficients" \
BIGOBJ=clcoef BO=cc BSTR="classical_coefficients"
Notes
1. The above are the default key values and so may be omitted.
2. The use of underscores in the descriptions instead of spaces between words.
3. The contents of qprog.txt are used to define the INSTRUCTIONS for producing the 
different module objects, of which BIGOBJ will become the first.
4. The example is that of a code xpc to calculate transport coefficients
according to different physical models of a plasma, of which the so-called classical
or Braginskii coeefficients will be the first, as object clcoef.
5. Each new code should be developed in a physically distinct repo - do not develop
more than one code in a 'qprog' repo, and do not try to push files back to the original repo.

Files input (note that the program-specific file will be used in preference to the generic one)
qprog.txt/xpc.txt contains the input variables that might be used by a range of different objects/modules
 and the default values for these inputs. These variables form part of the top level control QPROG_t
 for the program. A human readable variable for use in
 a namelist will be generated using the first 3 words of the description of each variable.
 In the example, a=... to lambda=... will be copied to QPROG.txt (xpc.txt) and finish in QPROG_h.f90
bigobj.txt/clcoef.txt contains the variables defining one object which will normally be defined using the
 instructions resulting from the input variables in qprog.txt, using additional object level controls
 (and of course code to be written by the user).
 In the example, tau_e... and c_tau_e... will be copied to BIGOBJ.txt (clcoef.txt)
 and finish in BIGOBJ_h.f90.

Files output and principal input functions as part of new QPROG (xpc) code
QPROG.f90 main program, calls QPROG_readcon (xpc_readcon) in module QPROG_m.f90
QPROG_h.f90 parameters describing (at least) how to construct first object BIGOBJ as
 Qnumerics_t (xpnumerics_t) which is to  be combined with other object data structures
 such as BIGOBJ_t into type QPROG_t
QPROG_m.f90 input from QPROGparameters (xpcparameters) in QPROG_readcon, with namelist variables as
 constructed from qprog.txt/xpc.txt, copied to  Qnumerics_t, *will generally need editing by hand*.
QPROG_case0.ctl input file for QPROG containing complete list of namelists
Qcontrol_h.f90 data structure of generic top level controls for QPROG abbreviated to Q
Qcontrol_m.f90 object of generic top level controls for QPROG  abbreviated to Q, calls BIGOBJ_readcon
 via Qcontrol_read.
BIGOBJ_h.f90 data structure of controls for BIGOBJ in type BOnumerics_t combined into type BIGOBJ_t,
 may need editing by hand for more complex applications.
BIGOBJ_m.f90 reads in object level controls, *will generally need editing by hand*.
makefile.QPROG makefile to compile and link QPROG (xpc)

In one example, edits to QPROG_m.f90 are
(1) QPROG_dia to call object diagnostics control routine BIGOBJ_dia, 
(2) QPROG_write to list key input parameters to .out file
(3) QPROG_writeg to call gnuplot output control routine BIGOBJ_writeg,
and edits to BIGOBJ_m.f90
(1) add to BIGOBJ_solve to do new work, 
(2) add to BIGOBJ_dia for new output to .log file
(3) add to BIGOBJ_writeg to output to .gnu file

Outputs from execution of QPROG
QPROG_case0.log log data such as date and time of run, cpu measured by internal clocks
QPROG_case0_QPROG.out indicative output, precisely object level controls for BIGOBJ

Updating auto-generated QPROG code
----------------------------------
At present, there is limited scope for updating, indeed repeated use of qprog.bash should be
avoided as likely to overwrite user-written code. The most likely need for new input variables
can be addressed by use of the variables provided as defaults, viz. 
general_real_parameters, number_of_real_parameters, general_integer_parameters and number_of_integer_parameters
which map as follows into Qnumerics namelist variables
selfn%nrpams=number_of_real_parameters
selfn%nipams=number_of_integer_parameters
selfn%rpar=general_real_parameters(:number_of_real_parameters)
selfn%npar=general_integer_parameters(:number_of_integer_parameters)
and will come into play when setting the namelist variable xpc_formula='additional'

This use is complicated by the fact that the same four "PAMS" variable names (short or long forms)
together with the  bigobj_formula variable necessarily appear in two places,
as there are two big objects produced by qprog.bash, namely xpc and clcoef. It helps anyway to explain
the structure for controlling input which is generic:
The split adopted in xpc.f90 is first, to initialise the control
structure (xpcontrol_h, methods in xpcontrol_m.f90), which of course
now consists of an aggregate of control structures, one for each object
(referred to as a sub-object) forming xpc_h. Each control
structure, typically qnumerics_h some q, is initialised as one or
more namelists in a single input file, when xpcontrol_read calls
structure_readcon, making use of the optional unit number argument.
(Program nucode also has a routine xpcontrol_fix which might be
used e.g. to enforce consistency on the various control structures.)

In the present example, 
(1) xpc is described by a namelist xpcparameters which is
 used to set object xpc%n of type xpnumerics containing the PAMS variables among others.
(2) clcoef is described by a namelist clcoefparameters which is
 used to set object xpc%clcoef%n of type ccnumerics containing the PAMS variables among others
 (since object clcoef is a sub-object of xpc).
xpcontrol_m  initialises by default 3 namelists designed to define global control variables 
 file, param and plot for xpc, respectively progfiles, miscparameters and plotselections.
 (The miscellaneous parameters are a character string, an integer, a real and a logical.)
Thereafter, xpcontrol_read calls 
 (1) xpc_readcon to read in type xpnumerics, checks the validity of the inputs and assign to xpc%n
 (2) clcoef_readcon to read in type ccnumerics, checks the validity of the inputs and assign to xpc%clcoef%n
 A special feature of the relatively simple qprog represented by xpc is that all the variables in the
 sub-object of type ccnumerics are set by copying their counterparts in xpnumerics
 (effectively xpc%clcoef%n=xpc%n), EXCEPT for the PAMS variables including bigobj_formula.
